# ES6 Promises
Javascript Promises sectino for the ALX SE program.

## Lessons learned
* A promise is basically saying _something will be done someday_ in code
* When exporting a function file in js, you use the export on the function and there are two cases:
### Case 1
```js
export function somefunction(){
}
```
When calling:
```js
import {somefunction} from functionFile
```
### Case 2
````js
export function somefunction(){
}
```
When calling:
```js
import {somefunction} from functionFile
```
